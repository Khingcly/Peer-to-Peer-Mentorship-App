## Project Overview


A medium-sized consulting firm wants to improve employee development by providing mentorship opportunities for its employees. They decide to implement the Peer-to-Peer Mentoring App, which is built using Power Apps.
The app allows employees to find and connect with mentors and mentees within the company, based on their areas of interest and experience. The app includes a matching algorithm that suggests potential mentors or mentees based on the employee's profile, and employees can also search for mentors or mentees manually.
Once a mentoring relationship is established, employees can communicate with one another through the app, schedule meetings.
The app also includes a dashboard for management, which provides real-time visibility into the mentoring relationships within the company. Managers can view the number of mentoring relationships, the areas of interest and experience, and the progress of the mentoring relationships.

# Peer-to-Peer-Mentorship-App

Using Microsoft Power Platform, I created a Model Driven Application that uses Power Automate and Power Bi to enhance the functionality of the process.

I joined Olarenwaju Oyinbooke's challenge. 
I recently took on one of Olanrewaju Oyinbooke's challenges [https://bit.ly/3FX0WAe] and created a Peer-to-Peer Mentorship App for a medium-sized company. The app allows Mentors and Mentees to create accounts and login into existing ones. Mentees can send mentorship requests to Mentors, who receive an automated approval email.
The app also has a report/dashboard for HR to see and includes a matching algorithm that suggests potential mentors or mentees based on the mentee's profile. The app uses Dataverse as the data source and leverages Power Apps functions like Patch, If, CountRows, IsBlank, Notify, Navigate, and more. I also employed the context of the global variable and UpdateContext variable in my application.
I'm excited to share my presentation of the application here: [https://bit.ly/3nlepep]. It was an incredible learning experience for me, and I'm proud of the final result.
